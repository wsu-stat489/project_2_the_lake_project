    "<p>Teams receive access to three core data sets for the event and a potential list of questions to consider for each data set. Because we want this event to be as “real world” as possible, the questions will only provide a starting point for your analysis. The primary goal of your analysis is to provide a thorough and insightful investigation of the relationship between various property characteristics and the water quality of lakes within the seven county Twin Cities region.</p>\n",
    "<p>We’re especially looking for examples of new, creative and innovative analysis to enhance the impact of your findings. Social Data Science is the primary client for this event, however; other organizations have already expressed interest in your findings. The implications of your results may influence many within this region and beyond.</p>\n",
    "<p><strong>Main Questions to Consider in Analysis</strong></p>\n",
    "<p>There are three overarching questions that should be considered in your analysis. These questions will require the use of all three data sets provided below. Additional or supplementary data sets may also be used at your discretion to answer these questions.</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>How does property value influence water quality?</li>\n",
    "<li>What property characteristics influence water quality the most?</li>\n",
    "<li>Have changes in land use or land development over time positively or adversely impacted water quality?</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "<p>In addition to the questions above, a potential list of questions has been provided below each data set as guidance. Consider these questions to be a diving board from which you can dive into the water data. All participants are expected to use their originality, creativity and ingenuity to provide the best findings, insights and recommendations possible.</p>\n",
